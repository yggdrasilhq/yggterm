# Pending bugs

Open, user-confirmed bugs that are NOT yet fixed. An agent asked to "finish the
pending bugs" should start here. Remove an entry (in the same commit as the
fix) once the fix is verified live on jojo.

- **THE STALE-DAEMON TRAP — read before diagnosing ANY "the fix didn't work".**
  A deploy that lands new binaries does NOT mean the new code is running. The
  daemon's idle gate defers its own retirement while any owned session is
  actively working — and on a campaign machine an agent session is ~always
  working, so the daemon can stay pinned indefinitely. On jojo 2026-07-11 the
  daemon ran **2.10.3 for 19h44m while 2.10.13 sat on disk**: the CR-faithful
  sanitizer fix and the CC re-birth fix from campaign run 1 were compiled,
  deployed, and never executed. Both bugs were still live for the user, and run 1
  had recorded them as "fixed on branch, live-verify pending" — the gap was
  invisible.
  **Always check `yggterm-headless server status → server_version` against the
  on-disk binary BEFORE concluding anything about a fix.** As of 2.10.14 the
  metadata sidebar's Daemon section surfaces version, uptime, a
  newer-build-on-disk flag, and the daemon's own deferral reason, plus a manual
  hot-restart button — so this is visible in the product rather than only to an
  agent who thinks to look.

- **Live-path frame corruption on busy CC sessions (jojo, 2026-07-10).** While
  an agent streams heavily, the CLIENT xterm buffer accumulates single-cell
  holes (`t ik` for `think`, including the user's own composer echo), merged
  rows, and whole frames interleaved at wrong positions — while the daemon
  vt100 screen stays clean and no `resync_required`/`cursor_rewound` events
  fire. So bytes are lost/mutated between the daemon read and `term.write` in
  the GUI. The ATTACH-seed variant of this class is fixed in 2.10.4 (viewport
  reconcile chunk); the live-path variant is still open. Prime suspects:
  (a) `batch_terminal_chunks` sanitizers rewriting live frames (the
  `observation` rejoin converts `\r\n`→`\n` and strips "noise" lines whenever
  a batch lacks alt-screen/hide-cursor/high-volume markers — content-triggered,
  so yggterm-dev sessions whose transcripts CONTAIN transport-noise phrases are
  hit hardest); (b) `terminal_write_bridge.stage_or_immediate` ordering under
  frame-budget mode. 2.10.4 ships the probes to convict: mine
  `terminal_forward_divergence` + `terminal_write_send_failed` in
  `event-trace.jsonl` and run the client-buffer vs daemon-screen diff recipe in
  `.agents/skills/yggui-app-control/SKILL.md` while a session streams.
  **UPDATE 2026-07-11 (telemetry campaign run 1): suspect (a) CONFIRMED.**
  `terminal_forward_divergence` fired on jojo (4/5 events on `local://`/`live::`
  sessions, drops of 1-11 bytes), and code trace convicted the sanitizers:
  `strip_internal_terminal_transport_noise_lines` did `.replace("\r\n","\n")` over
  the whole batch (content-gated on transport phrases, so it hits local dev
  sessions), and `strip_low_signal_terminal_noise_lines` used `str::lines().join`
  - both drop carriage returns, so xterm paints the next line at the wrong column
  (the staircase/interleave garble). Fixed in 2.10.13: both now `split('\n')`
  (CR-faithful); regression test
  `batch_terminal_chunks_preserves_carriage_returns_in_kept_lines`; the probe now
  emits `cr_dropped`. Suspect (b) not yet investigated.

  **UPDATE 2026-07-11 (run 2): the CR fix was NOT the whole bug — the excision
  itself is.** User re-reported (in different words): "local sessions are dropping
  chars sometimes and replacing the rendering with spaces." Run 1 sized the drops
  at 1-11 bytes and assumed CR loss was the entire mechanism. Re-mining
  `terminal_forward_divergence` found the real magnitude on the user's OWN session:

      local://20e56a8b   raw 9153  → forwarded 8474   = 679 bytes dropped
      local://20e56a8b   raw 23991 → forwarded 23312  = 679 bytes dropped

  679 bytes is a whole-line EXCISION, not a lost `\r`. Mechanism:
  `strip_internal_terminal_transport_noise_lines` content-matches three phrases
  (`terminal session not found`, `ignoring stale yggterm daemon…`, `hot update
  failed…`) and on a hit ALSO sets `drop_following_transport_tail_lines = 3` —
  deleting the matched line **plus the next three lines** of whatever the CLI was
  painting. A Claude Code session whose conversation quotes those phrases (an agent
  working on this very bug does) has four lines removed mid-frame. The daemon vt100
  screen stays clean, so every daemon-side instrument reports the session healthy —
  which is why this survived a run. Making the excision CR-faithful stopped the
  staircase garble but not the deletion.

  **Why it was NOT fixed in 2.10.14:** the excision cannot simply be removed. `ssh`
  writes `Shared connection to <ip> closed.` into the PTY, and yggterm's remote
  helper prints `Error: terminal session not found: <key>` to its stdout, which IS
  the PTY. Both arrive inside cursor-hide control batches, so no content-based or
  branch-based rule separates them from CLI output (5 existing tests lock this).
  The real fix is **per-session attach-phase state** — sanitize only while the
  launch wrapper owns the PTY, be a faithful pipe once the CLI does. That is the
  "collapse the forks / delete the accreted fixes" step of
  `campaign-render-pipeline-parity-rework`, which the user sequenced AFTER the
  parity harness. Deliberately not rushed into a deploy. The measurement, the
  mechanism, and the reason it can't be a one-liner are recorded in code at
  `batch_terminal_chunks`. **This is the next thing to do on that campaign.**

## Landed in code, live-activation OWED on jojo

- **Middle-click a link in a web surface → new tab (2.10.16, e408acd8).** Root
  cause found + fixed: the surface's WebView wired no `new_window_req_handler`, so
  WebKit's `create` signal (middle-click, ctrl/cmd-click, `target="_blank"`,
  `window.open`) returned a null widget and the link was dropped. Now routed into
  yggterm's tab model — background tab for middle/ctrl-click, foreground for
  `window.open`/`_blank`; egress + profile inherited. Unit-tested on the tab-model
  half. **OWED:** the WebKit create wiring needs a live surface with a real
  middle-click to exercise, which the offscreen Xvfb harness cannot do (it is
  native-surface-blind and app-control clicks never reach a child webview). jojo
  was pinned by a concurrent agent campaign when this landed, so no GUI restart.
  When jojo is free: deploy 2.10.16, open a web surface, middle-click a link, and
  confirm a background tab opens (trace `web_surface / new_tab_from_link`).

## Fixed in 2.10.2 — confirm live, then delete this section

- **Working-dot lag (10–45 s after the agent finished).** Root cause: the
  focused-terminal defer suspended ALL background snapshot applies, and
  snapshots were the only carrier of `working` flags. Fixed with the
  lightweight `WorkingFlags` daemon poll (2.5 s, defer-exempt) + in-place
  patching. Verify: watch `working_edge` events (source
  `working_flags_poll`) in `~/.yggterm/ui-telemetry.jsonl` while a background
  agent finishes; the dot should clear within ~3 s.
- **Collapsed local machine row never blinked.** Root cause: local agent
  sessions carry the loopback `ssh_target: "localhost"` for restore, which the
  local root's `ssh_target.is_none()` check excluded. Verify: collapse the
  local root while a local CC session works — the row must show the blinking
  working dot (`server app rows` → the `local` group row reports
  `busy: true, busy_reason: group_descendant_working`).
