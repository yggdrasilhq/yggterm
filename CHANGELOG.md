# Changelog

This file tracks user-visible changes in `yggterm`.

## Unreleased

## 2.1.14

### Fixed

- add a real auto-hide titlebar contract on Linux, including hover-reveal, empty-lane drag, double-click maximize/restore, and matching right-rail motion so custom chrome behaves like a native workspace shell instead of a decorative header
- fix the `+` menu seam and adjacent title/summary chip styling so the active launcher popover keeps the same rounded visual contract as the rest of the chrome instead of collapsing into a hard edge
- harden Linux maximize/restore and rounded-corner shape handling so flush-shell chrome survives round-trips without GTK shape warnings or broken input regions
- cap repeated WebKitGTK memory growth with a document-viewer cache model plus memory-pressure settings, and block regressions with a same-client `WebKitWebProcess` RSS soak gate
- extend the second-X11 smoke bundle to prove titlebar hover behavior, sidebar entry/exit animation, modal parity, maximize layout truth, and renderer memory budgets before packaging

## 2.1.13

### Fixed

- stop restored stored terminals from re-scheduling duplicate startup bootstrap work while the retained host lease is still active
- keep titlebar search, settings fields, sidebar actions, and terminal reclaim from stealing focus from each other during live interaction, so click-drag selection and terminal refocus still work after opening settings
- restore the Linux flush-shell corner contract after maximize round-trips and lock the smoke to the real `10px` radius/root-window proof instead of a DOM-only check
- keep dark-theme terminal rows readable by overriding low-contrast inline row backgrounds in the xterm DOM theme bridge
- harden the codex smoke against screenshot/state prompt races and dispatch-coupled idle render samples while still blocking semantic churn, inactive-host input leaks, and excessive terminal I/O

## 2.1.12

### Fixed

- catch the white perimeter halo on the real root window by sampling outer edge bands, while treating XRDP-safe opaque shells as a distinct flush-window profile instead of a false transparent-window failure
- remove the Linux opaque-window halo by making the nontransparent shell frame sit flush to the window bounds instead of keeping transparent-mode inset, rounding, and shadow chrome
- recover stale local PTY runtimes for app-control send/paste flows and tighten the plain-shell smoke so a visible prompt is not considered healthy unless the runtime is still writable

## 2.1.11

### Fixed

- add a real live terminal-zoom smoke that proves zoom changes resize visible rows, preserve the retained xterm host, keep the session interactive, and restore cleanly back to 100%
- harden rounded-corner artifact detection with repeated root-window captures so transient startup flashes are recorded while persistent square-corner failures still block packaging
- apply a one-time Linux transparent-window reconfigure pulse after spawn so the fresh client comes up with stable rounded corners instead of needing a manual minimize/restore nudge

## 2.1.10

### Fixed

- catch flaky square-corner window artifact regressions from the real root window instead of letting them slip past cropped app screenshots
- harden the real `:10.0` terminal smoke so late-suite Codex TUI vitality checks use contrast-aware paintedness instead of brittle dark-pixel assumptions on the light theme
- keep the release gate honest with richer sidebar and terminal observability for focus ownership, shell-frame geometry, and renderer diagnostics while leaving the readable DOM terminal path as the default

## 2.1.9

### Fixed

- keep live-session titles and summaries consistent across the active surface, sidebar, and restored session memory instead of letting the same session render with conflicting metadata
- harden retained-terminal behavior across startup restore, hot-session switching, titlebar search/settings focus, and duplicate terminal bootstrap scheduling so live sessions stay responsive instead of drifting into reloads or launcher boilerplate
- restore native-feeling terminal chrome by fixing the `+` menu shell, block-cursor contrast/inversion behavior, and related xterm light-theme regressions that slipped through the previous dev builds
- strengthen the real `:10.0` smoke gate so it catches the repeated menu, cursor, metadata, hot-session, and bootstrap regressions before packaging while skipping external `codex-session-tui` config failures that are not Yggterm bugs

## 2.1.8

### Fixed

- make the theme editor apply changes live, remove the stale `Apply Theme` step, and preserve grain-driven shell chrome even when the theme has no custom color stops
- keep clipboard image paste failures out of the PTY surface, stage local clipboard images through the local path instead of a bogus localhost SSH upload, and strengthen the related smoke coverage
- harden the xterm embed smoke so theme-editor, clipboard-image, and Codex TUI vitality checks run together and fail on the exact regressions that slipped into the last dev build

## 2.1.7

### Fixed

- restore direct-install self-update on Linux by shipping `yggterm-mock-cli` in the GitHub release archives again, so curl-installed machines like `jojo` can actually advance to the latest published version instead of aborting during update extraction
- remove the unconditional Cairo dependency from non-Linux desktop targets and keep the CI release packager aligned with the direct installer payload, reducing cross-platform release drift and unblocking the follow-up packaging pass

## 2.1.6

### Fixed

- filter unrecoverable local/document pseudo-live sessions out of restore and persisted daemon state, so fresh debug launches stop reopening empty `Live Sessions` ghosts, blank terminal rows, and stale remote-failure toasts
- harden the embedded xterm selection contract by forcing non-selectable terminal rows/canvas on the live DOM nodes and proving `user-select: none` through app-control, so browser text-selection artifacts stop leaking into the terminal surface
- strengthen the fresh-local terminal smoke to fail on empty live-session groups, wrong sidebar placement, missing busy-spinner recovery, or browser DOM selection leaking into the mounted xterm host

## 2.1.5

### Fixed

- stop helper-style CLI commands like `server snapshot` and `--help` from accidentally falling through into desktop window launch, so debug and packaging runs do not leave stray Yggterm windows behind
- add a GUI-side daemon watchdog for long-running desktop clients, so older windows recover when their helper daemon disappears instead of silently losing terminal input later
- remove the synthetic cursor overlay and keep the native xterm cursor as the visible contract, fixing the light-theme cursor artifacts and the hidden-cursor/TUI corruption path
- harden the `/status` terminal smokes so they require a real live Codex runtime, reject shell fallbacks like `bash: /status`, and accept alternate-buffer hidden-cursor proof from restore counters when a transient frame is missed
- stop low-signal boilerplate from winning local live-shell title generation, and keep local live shells anchored under the local tree instead of drifting into a live-sessions-only state

### Added

- add an in-repo demo and changelog evidence structure under `docs/demos/`, `artifacts/demos/`, and `.agents/skills/` so preview fixes, automation work, and future `yggui` features can ship with proof bundles instead of hand-written release-note guesses

### Docs

- document the shared `yggui` changelog/demo pipeline direction, including proof bundle format, scene style, and release-page ingestion, so `yggterm` can act as the first reusable template for future YggdrasilHQ desktop apps

## 2.1.4

### Added

- add `scripts/live_mode_cycle_check.py`, an SSH-driven app-control harness that flips a live Yggterm window from terminal to preview and back again, captures screenshots at each step, and records the actual usable timings instead of relying on guesswork

### Fixed

- stop `SetViewMode(Rendered)` from forcing a synchronous remote preview refresh through the daemon, so preview switches stop turning into hidden SSH refresh work and become usable again in about half a second on jojo
- remove the remaining extra terminal wrapper styling and keep the terminal viewport as a single surface, so terminal mode matches preview mode instead of carrying a second shell frame
- disable blurred/translucent overlay effects for KDE Wayland safe mode across the shell, context menus, delete overlay, toasts, and drag ghost chrome, reducing the compositor pressure that was still destabilizing Plasma on launch
- keep startup background remote refreshes out of the visible preview/terminal mode cycle, so the release-candidate harness no longer reproduces the old notification cascade or 40-second terminal reattach path

## 2.1.3

### Fixed

- restore the titlebar session title and summary dropdown even when the active session metadata arrives ahead of the full active-session object, so the title/summary controls stop disappearing during live remote restores
- remove the extra VS Code Light+ terminal shell framing, including the blue-tinted outer border treatment, so the light xterm surface returns to a cleaner single-surface terminal view
- stop sending `exit` into restored remote Codex sessions during app shutdown, using `/quit` for `remote-session://...` terminals instead so repeated Yggterm test runs do not litter the active Codex transcript
- harden remote helper bootstrap and launch reuse so broken `~/.yggterm/bin/yggterm` installs recover automatically and startup no longer explodes into remote helper mismatch storms
- reuse per-machine remote launch metadata for sidebar/live restore flows instead of re-resolving the same SSH helper path over and over during startup and remote refreshes

## 2.1.2

### Fixed

- prioritize active remote terminal restore over background remote-machine and managed-Codex refresh work, so a relaunched live SSH/Codex session paints before sidebar and tool-update churn kicks in
- remove duplicate startup terminal remounts and hide the sidebar "Refreshing tree..." chip while terminal mode is already live, so relaunches stop bouncing the terminal surface and shoving the tree around for no user benefit
- trim the GNU Screen resume path for remote Codex sessions and keep terminal reads on the dedicated terminal worker path, reducing the visible lag between xterm bootstrap and first meaningful remote output
- cache remote `yggterm` binary resolution across startup bursts instead of re-probing the same host repeatedly, cutting needless SSH round-trips during startup and remote refreshes
- make perf, trace, and UI telemetry appends atomic so `perf-telemetry.jsonl`, `event-trace.jsonl`, and UI telemetry stay machine-readable under concurrent startup and background activity
- strengthen the built-in VS Code-style light terminal palette so Codex content reads with clearer separation instead of washing into a flat white terminal slab

## 2.1.0

### Added

- add `server app state`, `server app focus`, and `server app screenshot` as the first SSH-reachable YggUI app-control verbs, so a running desktop client can be inspected and driven through its own control plane instead of external desktop guesswork

### Fixed

- replace the Linux app screenshot path with a native WebKitGTK surface capture, so Yggterm can screenshot itself without depending on `spectacle`, `gnome-screenshot`, `import`, or DOM-to-canvas fallback code

## 2.0.29

### Fixed

- switch the light xterm theme to a VS Code-style light palette, so Codex terminal surfaces regain the expected input-region contrast instead of blending into a flat white canvas
- tighten sidebar row spacing and trim the adjacent tree icon size slightly, so dense remote/session trees read more like a workspace navigator and less like a roomy file browser

## 2.0.28

### Fixed

- stop biasing in-app toast notifications to the left when a right rail is open, so progress and clipboard notifications stay visually centered in the window
- collapse the preview header summary down to the stored precis once the preview body scrolls, so long summaries stop dominating the top of the session while reading deeper into the thread
- stop re-running sidebar active-row auto-scroll on every reactive update, which was forcing the tree back to the current session and causing the flicker/dancing bug while trying to browse elsewhere
- retune the light xterm palette toward a cleaner GitHub-style base so Codex composer surfaces regain visible contrast instead of blending into the terminal background

## 2.0.27

### Added

- add `server screenshot app [output_path]` so a live Yggterm window can capture itself on demand, letting remote debugging and support bundles include the actual in-app state instead of guessing from the desktop around it
- make the screenshot capture path cross-platform with Linux, macOS, and Windows native backends plus a frontend fallback, so the same tracing workflow can travel with Yggterm instead of depending on one host compositor setup

### Fixed

- centralize the shipped icon assets behind one canonical SVG-plus-generated-PNG workflow, so window chrome, desktop integration, and future `yggui` apps stop drifting onto different icon artwork again
- expose a reusable `yggui` window-icon loader from PNG bytes, so future apps using the shell layer can plug in their own icon without copying the decode boilerplate or falling back to stale raster assets

## 2.0.26

### Added

- add an always-on `event-trace.jsonl` probe stream under `~/.yggterm`, with timestamped GUI, daemon, remote-session, managed-cli, and UI-surface events that can be tailed live without attaching a debugger
- add `server trace tail`, `server trace follow`, and `server trace bundle --screenshot` commands so sluggish runs can be inspected remotely over SSH and bundled with recent perf telemetry, UI telemetry, daemon state, panic logs, and a best-effort screenshot
- mirror high-value UI telemetry events into the shared trace stream so slow tree, preview, and session-open flows can be correlated against the daemon-side work instead of guessing across separate logs

### Fixed

- rotate the event trace automatically once it grows past a safe size, so long-running dogfooding sessions keep probes enabled without the log itself becoming a new source of startup or IO drag

## 2.0.25

### Fixed

- scope remote Codex session discovery to the actual SSH login user's `~/.codex`, so a machine no longer advertises sessions from a different account that the selected SSH target cannot resume
- preserve `remote-session://...` restore identity for cached live remotes even when the scanned session has disappeared, so launch prep still takes the remote resume path instead of silently downgrading to the wrong attach flow
- fall back from `codex resume <id>` to the interactive `codex resume` picker when a saved remote session ID is gone, keeping the terminal alive instead of closing the SSH tab on a stale restore

## 2.0.24

### Fixed

- keep only `yggterm.desktop` visible in Linux menus while leaving `dev.yggterm.Yggterm.desktop` as a hidden compatibility entry, so KDE no longer has two equally named menu candidates fighting over icon resolution
- force KDE desktop caches harder during integration by clearing stale per-user sycoca/icon caches, rebuilding with `--noincremental`, and nudging Plasma to refresh the current shell after the desktop files change

## 2.0.23

### Fixed

- point both Linux desktop entries at the shipped SVG file directly instead of relying on icon-theme name lookup, so KDE panel and menu paths can render the same icon artwork that already shows up correctly in desktop grid views

## 2.0.22

### Fixed

- disable the crashing GTK accessibility bridge by default on Linux unless `YGGTERM_ENABLE_ACCESSIBILITY=1` is set, which keeps jojo-style KDE/Wayland launches from dying in `libatk-bridge` before the window appears
- add a `yggterm.desktop` compatibility entry alongside `dev.yggterm.Yggterm.desktop`, plus extra SVG icon copies, so KDE menu and launcher lookup has both the strict desktop-id path and the plain legacy name available
- make direct-install launchers and packaged wrappers carry the same Linux accessibility guard before GTK/WebKit boot, so launcher/menu starts behave like direct binary starts instead of crashing differently
- ship `yggterm-mock-cli` in release archives, direct installs, and the `.deb`, so native startup, daemon, and integration issues can be diagnosed with the same installed tool users have on their machines

## 2.0.21

### Fixed

- corrected the shipped PNG icon so the runtime window icon and KDE launcher icon finally match the canonical SVG artwork instead of showing the broken raster fallback
- aligned Linux desktop integration around the `dev.yggterm.Yggterm` desktop identity, including duplicate icon names for the desktop file and theme cache refreshes that KDE can actually resolve
- replaced the old hide-on-close desktop behavior with a real client shutdown path, so closing one live client no longer leaves a hidden stale process behind
- kept restart-into-update from tearing down the daemon in between client handoff, so a client restart does not unnecessarily kill running sessions
- added a lightweight `--version` / `-V` CLI path so launcher and diagnostic checks do not accidentally boot the full GUI

## 2.0.20

### Fixed

- replaced the direct-install Linux launcher with a stable wrapper that reads `install-state.json`, so stale symlinks can no longer leave the desktop entry or shell command pinned to an older broken binary after self-update
- made direct self-update hand desktop integration refresh to the freshly installed binary, instead of trusting the older running binary to rewrite launchers and icons correctly
- aligned the shipped PNG window/launcher icon asset with the canonical SVG source so the runtime icon and installed desktop icon stop drifting
- stopped remote scan helper commands from panicking on broken stdout pipes during startup and shutdown races

## 2.0.19

### Fixed

- normalize remote machine aliases during restore and connection so alternate host aliases map to canonical machine identities consistently, improving remote session continuity across reconnects.

## 2.0.18

### Fixed

- make Linux direct installs register the desktop launcher like a direct app instead of a distro package: stable `Exec` via `~/.local/bin/yggterm` and a stable absolute `Icon` path under `~/.local/share/yggterm/direct/`
- keep the theme/pixmaps icon copies as fallback, but stop relying on KDE theme-name resolution alone for the primary launcher icon
- publish release checksum sidecars consistently so direct self-update does not fail on missing `.sha256` assets
- only shut down Yggterm server sessions when the last live client closes, so closing one of multiple open windows no longer tears down the others
- treat Linux termination signals like a graceful close path too, so KDE panel/taskbar close does not bypass daemon shutdown semantics

## 2.0.17

### Fixed

- make remote Codex discovery resilient when an SSH target logs in as a different user than the one that owns the session archive, so default `~/.codex` scans still find machine-wide homes like `/home/pi/.codex`
- keep `yggterm-headless` robust for root-login remotes by letting the remote scan path fall back to real machine user homes instead of reporting a misleading healthy `0 sessions`

## 2.0.16

### Fixed

- make stale `offline` SSH machines refresh again on startup instead of being treated as already-known forever
- add a cooldown to automatic remote machine refresh retries so a bad host does not spin forever
- refresh Linux desktop integration more aggressively for KDE by installing the themed icon into `pixmaps/` and forcing both icon and desktop menu cache updates
- keep direct self-update installing `yggterm-headless` alongside `yggterm`

### Docs

- added a standalone product thesis in `PRODUCT_THESIS.md`
- rewrote the README opening to better explain the core user, pain, and wedge
